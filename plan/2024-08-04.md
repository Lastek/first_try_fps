    I basically have a good starting point. Input is handled and actions are working. Now I need to make the movement feel responsive. I do not want to have any hard friction or sluggish feeling for the player. I think I'll do something that feels Quake 3 CPM-ish but less air control and slightly higher friction./

    I don't think that it's critical at this point to get movement and the feel perfect but I do need to decide on the mechanics. I'm shooting for half-life style of story telling (linear) and diverse environments. This means having solid movement and movement based puzzles. I want elements of puzzle games as well. I want something logical and tough but very learnable through incremental teaching of the player. /
    
    This incremental aspect will also apply to movement. However, I'm leaning strongly towards controller support. This may or may not be my concern in this current game prototype but that will be a part of the mechanics planning process./
