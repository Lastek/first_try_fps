So, I've implemented CPM style movement. Just needs tweaking and refining for more control.

Still working how to do the movement code properly but so far it's working well. State management is still rought. Had to move around some if statements to get things from bugging out. Trying to find a starting point for a state management system; nothing too complex but enough to handle multiple inputs reliably. 

Things in the pipeline:
- Level design via netradiant-custom and func_godot
- new state management system
- AI navigation code
- Figuring out what kind of algos to use for AI/NPC. I like Dark Souls goal planning but it depends on what kind of game I'm going for.
- Gathering assets. Mainly textures.
- Developing an Overarching Idea (tm) of where I'm going with this game.
